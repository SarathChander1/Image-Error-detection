Given the diverse types of image noise, the study introduces specific filters to cater to varied user
requirements, aiming to either reduce or increase noise. The choice to utilize OpenCV is underlined by its
versatility as a library designed for an extensive range of computer vision tasks. Compatible with objectoriented languages such as Python, C++, and Java, OpenCV is available on multiple platforms, including
iOS, Android, OS X, Linux, and Windows. Interfaces based on OpenCL and CUDA are actively developed
for efficient GPU functions.
The OpenCV Python API is referred to as OpenCV Python. It combines the Python programming language
with the OpenCV C++ API. Furthermore, using Numpy to help with the assignment makes it easier to
complete. Numpy is an advanced standard library for numerical activities. It is filled with several basic and
advanced features, very simple to pick up and available for many languages of programming.
It will be easy for us to provide different kinds of filters. In this we are dealing with some noises like salt and
pepper noise, speckle noise. We can also enhance the edges of an image to detect the feature of that image.
Mean filter, median filter, Gaussian filter and bilateral filter are some of the well-known filters.
